Please see the following app specific README.md files for more info on their architecture and how to run them.
* FlightSearcherClient/README.md
* FlightSearcherServer/Airports/README.md

# Quick Start
* Run server using Visual Studio. It should appear on 127.0.0.1:8081
* In the directory of the client app: Install Node `8.9.0` then run `npm install` then run `npm run dev` .
* The app should be working on 127.0.0.1:8080. 

The video in this folder shows me doing these quick start steps along with a full client production build.
